<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p>My main research interests are in wireless communications, signal processing, and machine learning. The current focus is on the theory and application of intelligent 
wireless systems, including learning-based communication signal processing, radio resource management, and machine learning over wireless networks.</p>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>I usually have 1-2 Ph.D. and 3-4 Master's openings every year. Please drop me an email if you are interested in working with me.<br />
我一般每年会招收1-2名博士生和3-4名硕士生。如果你对无线通信、信号处理、机器学习等方向有兴趣，欢迎与我联系，谢谢。<br /></p>
<p><i>To have an idea on what we do on a day-to-day basis, the tools we frequently use in research include deep/reinforcement/federated learning, graph neural networks, variational inference/MCMC, and optimization</i>. <br /><br />
The applications we're interested in include: <br /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Resource allocation in cellular/V2X/Wi-Fi networks</p>
</li>
<li><p>Collaborative perception for autonomous driving</p>
</li>
<li><p>Semantic communications and MIMO </p>
</li>
</ul>
