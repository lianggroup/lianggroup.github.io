<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p>My main research interests are in wireless communications, signal processing, and machine learning. The current focus is on the theory and application of intelligent 
wireless systems, including learning-based communication signal processing, radio resource management, and machine learning over wireless networks.</p>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>I usually have 1-2 Ph.D. and 3-4 Master's openings every year. Please drop me an email if you are interested in working with me.<br />

<p><i>To have an idea on what we do on a day-to-day basis, the tools we frequently use in research include deep/reinforcement/federated learning, graph neural networks, variational inference/MCMC, and optimization</i>.
<i>The applications we're interested in are resource allocation in cellular/V2X/Wi-Fi networks, collaborative perception for autonomous driving, semantic communications, and MIMO</i>. </p>
